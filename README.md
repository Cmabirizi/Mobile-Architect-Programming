# CS 360 Module Eight Journal - Mobile App Development

## App Overview

This app is designed to help small businesses efficiently manage their inventory. It allows users to track products, update inventory levels, and receive SMS notifications when stock is low. The primary goal of the app is to streamline inventory management, reduce errors associated with manual tracking, and ensure that business owners are alerted before running out of stock.

## Screens and Features

The app includes the following essential screens and features:
- **Login Screen**: Secure authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the app.
- **Inventory Screen**: A screen to view products, search for specific items, and update their details.
- **Add/Update Product Screen**: A form for adding new products or updating existing product information.
- **SMS Notification Screen**: Sends SMS alerts when stock levels fall below a set threshold.

The UI was designed to be simple, intuitive, and user-centered. Features such as clear labels, logical flow, and easy-to-read buttons were implemented to make the app user-friendly and ensure users can quickly navigate and perform tasks.

## App Design and Development Process

### Coding Approach

I approached the development process by breaking the project into manageable chunks. I started by ensuring the core functionalities, like login and inventory tracking, were working properly before implementing additional features. I used an agile methodology, testing after every change, and ensured my code was modular and well-organized. This approach allowed me to efficiently build and update the app without feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the project.

### Testing

Testing was done both on an emulator and a physical Android device (Samsung Galaxy S10e). I tested critical functionalities such as login, inventory management, and SMS notifications. Additionally, I tested for usability, ensuring the app was easy to navigate and functional. Testing helped me identify bugs like incorrect input field validation and screen transition issues, allowing me to improve the app's performance and user experience.

### Innovation

During development, I encountered a challenge when deciding how to handle adding and editing product details. Initially, I planned to create separate screens for each task, but I innovated by using a dynamic UI that adapts based on the task (adding or editing). This reduced the number of screens and made the app more streamlined and user-friendly.

### Successes and Key Achievements

I was particularly successful in integrating the SMS notification feature, which required working with third-party APIs to send notifications. This feature demonstrates my understanding of integrating external libraries and APIs and ensuring the app can reliably send notifications to users based on inventory levels.

## Conclusion

This project was a valuable opportunity to apply mobile app development skills and create a functional, user-friendly app. Through the design, development, and testing processes, I learned the importance of user-centered design and iterative testing. The app is now fully functional and can be used by small businesses to efficiently manage inventory, making it a great addition to my portfolio.
